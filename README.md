 **Abstract**: Moving object detection is a critical task for autonomous
vehicles. As dynamic objects represent higher collision
risk than static ones, our own ego-trajectories have to be
planned attending to the future states of the moving elements of the scene. Motion can be perceived using temporal
information such as optical flow. In this work we propose
a new end-to-end architecture to detect the moving vehicles
in Bird’s eye view representation. The core idea behind our
approach is to get the bird’s eye view representation first
and then to detect the moving vehicles using either Correlation or Cross-Attention We demonstrate the impact of our
algorithm on Nuscenes dataset. To the best of our knowledge, there has been limited or no prior research conducted
on this particular topic. In this work, we introduce a novel
contribution to the field of moving object segmentation on
the nuScenes dataset. We have generated custom labels that
accurately annotate moving objects, which were not previously available. These labels enhance the dataset’s utility
for precise analysis and understanding of moving objects.
To promote reproducibility, we will release the code used for
generating these labels to the research community, allowing for further exploration and advancements in this area.
We achieved IoU Score of 26 percent .
